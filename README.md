# USB-Condom
## Introduction
A USB-Condom is a Data-Blocker, which prevents you from getting a victim of BAD-USB.
If you now wonder what BAD-USB mean, visit this short <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BadUSB">Wikipedia article</a> or watch the following video from <a href="https://www.blackhat.com/us-14/video/badusb-on-accessories-that-turn-evil.html">Blackhat 2014</a>.
Ultimately, BAD-USB is nothing more than a manipulated USB device. After the manipulation, it can then for example act as an input device (HID).

## What is this USB-Condom doing to protect me?
### Unconnected data pins
* This USB-Condom is basend on the simplest method a USB-Condom can be created. There is a USB plug soldered with a usb USB port. Only the datapins are left out. This makes it's impossible for a BAD-USB device to communicate with your end device.
If the adapter is between your device and the BAD-USB device, only electricity can be transferred for simple charging
